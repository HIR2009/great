  <p>The
 
Great Dividing Range, also called Great Divide, Eastern Highlands, or Eastern Cordillera, main watershed of eastern Australia; <br>
it comprises a series of plateaus and low mountain ranges roughly paralleling the coasts of Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria for 2,300 miles (3,700 km, <br> 
and topographically complex, the range begins in the north on Cape York Peninsula, Queensland. Within that state the ranges‚Äô average elevation is 2,000‚Äì3,000 feet (600‚Äì900 metres), <br></p>
<p></div>
<div class="help"><p>but they rise as high as 5,000 feet (1,500 metres) in the Bellenden Ker and McPherson ranges and the Lamington Plateau. Farther south the highlands average 3,000 feet; a segment known as the Australian Alps, <br>
near the New South Wales‚ÄìVictoria border, contains Australia‚Äôs highest peak, Mount Kosciuszko (7,310 feet [2,228 metres]). The highlands finally bend westward in Victoria to terminate in the Grampians, while a southern spur emerges from the Bass Strait to form the central uplands of insular Tasmania.</p> </div>
