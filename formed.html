  <strong><h2>When Was The Great Dividing Range Formed</h2>
  <div class="thing">
  <p>
    The Great Dividing Range was formed during the Carboniferous period—over 300 million years ago—when Australia collided <br>
    with what are now parts of South America and New Zealand.The range has experienced significant erosion since. 

    For tens of thousands of years prior to British colonisation the ranges were home to various Aboriginal Australian nations and clans. <br>
    Evidence remains in some places of their traditional way of life including decorated caves, campsites and trails used to travel between the coastal and inland regions. <br>
     Many descendants of these nations still exist today, and some remain the traditional owners and custodians of their lands.
