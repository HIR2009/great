  <p>
    Unlike most mountain ranges, the Great Dividing Range is not caused by collision or subduction. <br>
    In fact it isn‚Äôt really a mountain range at all. The entire area was uplifted by as much as one kilometer. <br> 
    The eastern edge of the uplifted region sloped towards the sea. Rivers on this slope caused erosion, and <br>
    turned the slope into a steep edge which was slowly forced back into the land. <br>
     Climb up the steep slope, and you will find that what is a mountain from one side, <br>
     is an escarpment from the other. The uplift started around 80 million years ago but different parts of the range do not all have the same age. <br>
     The current edge of the escarpment was reached about 3 million years ago: it has been fairly stable since. Volcanoes occur both on the escarpment and on the eroded plains, but only one lava flow, a young one dated at 3 million years, comes over the escarpment. The largest of the volcanoes was probably Mount Tweed with its peak Mount Warning, <br>
      on the coastal plains. It was between 2 and 3 km tall and had a volume of 4000 cubic kilometer but it has been eroded down to a remnant. One has to be amazed, and echo Lady Macbeth: Who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him? Mount Warning is not a volcanic neck, but rather a solidified magma chamber, dug out by erosion which removed the softer rock surrounding it. <br>
